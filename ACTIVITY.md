No work

### Week Q2.2 (Nov 17+)

- Caio: https://github.com/doda25-team16/app/pull/3
I have worked on F5, F4 and F3 for the frontend of the project. This envolved creating the dockerfile for the front end, making it work for multiple architectures and making it have multiple stages. I have also reviewed a few pull requests created by my peers.
- Ignas: I have worked on F3, F4, F5 for the backend. This meant containerizing the backend, making it multi architecture and multi stage. Also I set up the backend repo, and ran the initial model setup.
- Yuting: https://github.com/doda25-team16/operation/pull/18

    I have worked on F6, and F7 of A1. For F6, I enabled the possibility of flexible ports on which each service runs. And for F7, I created the necessary configuration file and documentation for running and operating application.
