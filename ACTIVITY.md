### Week Q2.1 (Nov 10+)

No work

### Week Q2.2 (Nov 17+)

- Caio: https://github.com/doda25-team16/app/pull/3
I have worked on F5, F4 and F3 for the frontend of the project. This envolved creating the dockerfile for the front end, making it work for multiple architectures and making it have multiple stages. I have also reviewed a few pull requests created by my peers.
- Ignas: I have worked on F3, F4, F5 for the backend. This was running all the initial model setup, and building the container to use the model in.
